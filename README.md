## PostgreSQL Role üóÑÔ∏è
- **Database Setup**:
  - Employee data stored in normalized tables: `employees`, `performance`, `retention`.
- **Sample Queries**:
  ```sql
  -- Gender Distribution
  SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM employees
  GROUP BY gender;

  -- Average Performance by Department
  SELECT department, AVG(performance_score) AS avg_score
  FROM performance
  GROUP BY department;
